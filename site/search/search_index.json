Installing Python","text":"<ul> <li>First things first: Checking if Python is already installed. For that I just checked for the Versions using <code>py --version</code> or <code>python --version</code></li> <li>Since for me it wasn't installed, I went on installing it. I used <code>winget install --id Python.Python.3 --source winget</code> to install it over Powershell, which seamed the most strait forward way to do it. </li> <li>Then I got to my first bump in the road: <code>py --version</code> worked, but <code>python --version</code> did not. For that I wanted to figure out what the actual difference is</li> </ul> <p>!!! note \"Difference py and python command\"     <code>py</code> is the launcher. <code>python</code> is the interpreter.     - <code>py</code> is a small helper program that comes with the official Python installation on Windows. Its only job is to find and launch the correct version of Python installed on your system.     Think of it as the middleman, the bouncer at the club door asking, \"Which Python do you want?\"     - <code>python</code> is the actual executable \u2014 the real Python interpreter. When you type <code>python</code>, you're telling your system, \"Run this specific program.\"     Why does this matter?     Because on a fresh Windows install:     py will usually work, even if your system PATH isn\u2019t set up right.     - <code>python</code> might be broken or hijacked by the Microsoft Store\u2019s fake shortcut \u2014 leading to frustration and confusion.     Bottom line:     - Use <code>py</code> when your system is fresh and you\u2019re still figuring things out.     - But for full control and compatibility (especially with scripts, tools, and virtual environments), make sure <code>python</code> points to your real install \u2014 and then use <code>python</code> from that point forward.     If <code>py</code> is the butler, <code>python</code> is the king.     Eventually, you don\u2019t want to talk to the butler anymore.</p> <ul> <li>Disabled Microsoft Store shortcut trap</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#2-installed-mkdocs","title":"2.
