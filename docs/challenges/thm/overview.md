# TryHackMe Overview

This page tracks my hands-on work with TryHackMe.  
It’s part of my challenge archive — where I test skills, reinforce fundamentals, and practice documenting like a pentester.

## Why TryHackMe?

TryHackMe offers structured learning paths and guided labs that complement my work on Hack The Box.  
I use it to:

- Build foundational knowledge in a controlled environment
- Practice reporting and write-ups in a professional format
- Explore modules that fill gaps in my understanding

## Learning Path Progress

I’m currently working through:

- **Pre-Security**  
  Basic networking, Linux, and web concepts — good for grounding.

- **Complete Beginner**  
  Enumeration, privilege escalation, and basic exploitation.

- **Jr Penetration Tester**  
  More realistic labs, including Active Directory, web attacks, and reporting.

Each module I complete will be linked below if I write it up.

## Documented Rooms

- [Room Name](billing.md)  
  Focused on exploiting MagnusBilling through unauthenticated remote command execution and privilege escalation via Fail2Ban.


## Reporting Practice

Each write-up is structured like a mini pentest report:

- **Summary** — What the room covers and what I learned
- **Enumeration** — Tools used and initial findings
- **Exploitation** — Steps taken to gain access
- **Post-Exploitation** — Flags captured, persistence, cleanup
- **Reflection** — What I’d do differently, what I want to learn next

This page is a log of my practice — not just what I solved, but how I think through problems.  
It’s also where I sharpen my documentation skills, one room at a time.
