# EchoSnare

## Vision

So since a while I have been interested in Networking. 
With that a big part of understanding is working out how everything fits together. 
And so I started to think about what I can do to understand where I am, and what surrounds me in the Internet. 
What paths does my traffic usually follow. 
Can I find out where it differs. 
And I already have a few good Ideas of how to start maping out the cables I am using all day long to talk, game, and watch stuff.

Now it also happend that I can to see something special. 
Something that probably always peaked my interest, but I have never really felt ready to dive deeper. 
Well I am ready. 
I have learned a lot, and I feel ready to get my feet wet trying to **really** understand what IoT means and what it is can do. 
I found an ESP32 Dev board with battery, case, Oled Display and LoRa Modul. 
So what do I want to do with it. Everything. 
But for now I want to build my own Wifi_Sniffer.

## Tools of the Hunt

Here are the tools I plan to use for this project. 

### Hardware

* ESP32 LoRa V3 Development Board
* 3000mAh LiPo battery
* Meshtastic case
* Smartphone (for eventual geotagging)
* PC running some Linux Distro

### Software

* MicroPython
* Nvim (with MicroPython plugin)
* rshell
* ampy

## Battle Station Setup

This is the first real move in the direction of actually doing something after the planing face.
I need to get my Nvim setup for MicroPython.
For that I need to install all the dependicies I will need to finish this projcet.
Then I set up my Nvim to have Highlighting, etc. 

## Flash and Burn

Then the next step will be flashing the right firmware and making sure MicroPython.
