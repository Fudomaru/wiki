# Foundations

---

Every system sits on foundations.  
Most people skip them, chasing tools, commands, and quick wins.  
But without the bigger picture, you’re just pushing buttons you don’t understand.  

This part of the dojo is about **systems thinking** — the layers that make everything else possible.

## What belongs here

- [**Linux**](/foundations/linux/overview/) — my home turf, the kernel, CLI, and internals.  
- [**Windows**](/foundations/windows/overview/) & [**macOS**](/foundations/macos/overview/) — different philosophies, different layers, worth understanding.  
- **Android & iOS** — mobile platforms, their architecture, and security implications.  
- **Networking** — because no system lives alone.  

Maybe later I’ll branch into Unix flavors, FreeBSD, or deeper dives into protocols. The point is the same: **see the forest, not just the trees.**

## Why foundations matter

When you’re deep in the weeds of a bug, a config file, or a CTF exploit, it’s easy to forget the structure holding it all together.  
But every exploit, every optimization, every “trick” sits on top of something bigger:  

- A system call.  
- A kernel abstraction.  
- A network handshake.  
- A design philosophy baked in decades ago.  

If I can trace problems back to those roots, then nothing is really “magic” anymore.

## How I’ll use this space

This section isn’t a tutorial library. It’s my map of the territory.  
Expect diagrams, concepts, and key workflows that explain *how the machine actually works*.  

When I get lost in the bytes, I’ll come back here.  
This page is my reminder: **mastery means never losing sight of the foundations.**
