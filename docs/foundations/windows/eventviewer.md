# Windows Event Log Deep Dive

## What Is the Windows Event Log?

The Windows Event Log is a centralized system for recording events that occur across the operating system, applications, and security components.  
It’s a vital tool for defenders monitoring suspicious activity — and a potential goldmine for attackers seeking insight, disruption, or stealth.

> Think of it as the system’s diary: every login, crash, warning, and audit gets written down — if you know where to look.

## Log Categories

Windows organizes events into several categories, each serving a different purpose:

| Log Category       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System             | Events from Windows system components. E.g., a service failing at startup.  |
| Security           | Security-related events like logins, file access, and audit results.        |
| Application        | Events from installed software. E.g., Slack failing to launch.              |
| Setup              | OS installation and domain setup events (especially on domain controllers). |
| Forwarded Events   | Logs forwarded from other machines in the network.                          |

---

## Event Types

Each log entry falls into one of five types:

| Event Type     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Error          | A major issue, like a failed service or driver.                             |
| Warning        | A potential problem, such as low disk space.                                |
| Information    | Successful operations, like a driver loading correctly.                     |
| Success Audit  | A successful security access attempt (e.g., login).                         |
| Failure Audit  | A failed security access attempt (e.g., wrong password).                    |

> Multiple failure audits in a short time? Could be password spraying.

## Severity Levels

Windows assigns a severity level to each event, helping prioritize response:

| Severity Level | Level # | Description                                                         |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verbose        | 5       | Progress or success messages.                                       |
| Information    | 4       | Event occurred, no issues.                                          |
| Warning        | 3       | Potential problem worth investigating.                              |
| Error          | 2       | System or service issue, not urgent.                                |
| Critical       | 1       | Serious issue requiring immediate attention.                        |

## Where Logs Live

Event logs are stored as `.evtx` files in:

`C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs`


The **Windows Event Log service** (inside `svchost.exe`) manages these logs.  
It starts automatically at boot and is hard to disable without destabilizing the system.

> If you’re trying to hide your tracks, this service is a high-value target — but messing with it can break the system.

## Interacting with Logs

### Using `wevtutil`

This command-line utility lets you query, export, and manage logs.

- Display last 5 Security events in text format:  

  `wevtutil qe Security /c:5 /f:text`

- Export System log for offline analysis:  

  `wevtutil epl System SystemLog.evtx`

> Admin rights are required for most `wevtutil` operations.

---

### Using PowerShell

PowerShell offers flexible log interaction via `Get-WinEvent`.

- List all logs and record counts:  

  `Get-WinEvent -ListLog *`

- Filter by log name, event ID, or time range:  

  `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4624; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-1)`

> PowerShell is ideal for automation and parsing — especially in incident response scripts.

---

## Security Implications

Event logs aren’t just for defenders. Attackers can:

- **Enumerate logs** to understand logging depth (default vs granular).
- **Extract credentials** from logs left behind by misconfigured systems.
- **Tamper or clear logs** to hide activity.
- **Detect security controls** based on audit failures and alerts.

> Pro tip: Always check for log clearing events. They’re often the first sign of an intruder trying to cover their tracks.

## Recommended Monitoring (To Be Expanded)

In Active Directory environments, certain logs are critical to monitor.  
This section will grow as I explore best practices for log auditing and SIEM integration.

## Final Thoughts

Windows Event Logs are a defender’s best friend — and an attacker’s reconnaissance tool.  
Learning to read them fluently is a key skill for any aspiring red teamer or pentester.

> The logs don’t lie. But they can be silenced — if you don’t know what to listen for.
