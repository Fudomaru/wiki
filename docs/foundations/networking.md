# Networking Overview

This page is my launchpad into the world of networking.  
It’s where I collect the core concepts, tools, and systems that shape how machines talk to each other.  
Each item here is a placeholder for deeper dives as I explore further.

## Protocols & Models

- **OSI Model**  
  A conceptual framework that breaks networking into seven layers, from physical wires to application logic.

- **TCP/IP Stack**  
  The real-world implementation of networking, built on transport and internet layers.

- **DHCP**  
  Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

- **DNS**  
  Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

- **HTTP/HTTPS**  
  Protocols for web communication, including headers, methods, and status codes.

- **SSH**  
  Secure shell protocol for remote access and tunneling.

- **FTP/SFTP**  
  File transfer protocols, with and without encryption.

## Tools & Utilities

- **Ping**  
  Tests basic connectivity by sending ICMP echo requests.

- **Traceroute**  
  Maps the path packets take to reach a destination.

- **Curl**  
  Sends HTTP requests to test web services and APIs.

- **Netcat**  
  A versatile tool for opening ports, sending data, and debugging connections.

- **Wireshark**  
  Captures and analyzes network traffic at the packet level.

- **Tcpdump**  
  Command-line packet sniffer for quick traffic inspection.

- **Nmap**  
  Scans networks for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

- **ss / netstat**  
  Shows active connections and listening ports.

## Configuration & Management

- **IP addressing**  
  Static vs dynamic IPs, subnetting, and CIDR notation.

- **Routing tables**  
  How packets find their way across networks.

- **Firewall rules**  
  Controlling traffic with iptables, nftables, or Windows Firewall.

- **VPNs**  
  Secure tunnels between networks, including WireGuard and OpenVPN.

- **Proxy servers**  
  Intermediaries for traffic routing, caching, and filtering.

## Network Types & Topologies

- **LAN/WAN**  
  Local vs wide area networks, and how they differ in scope and control.

- **VLANs**  
  Virtual LANs for segmenting traffic within a physical network.

- **Mesh vs Star vs Ring**  
  Common topologies and their trade-offs.

- **Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer**  
  Different models of communication and control.

## Security & Monitoring

- **Port scanning**  
  Identifying open services and potential attack surfaces.

- **Packet inspection**  
  Reading traffic to detect anomalies or malicious behavior.

- **IDS/IPS**  
  Intrusion detection and prevention systems.

- **MITM attacks**  
  How attackers intercept traffic and how to defend against it.

- **TLS/SSL**  
  Encryption protocols for securing data in transit.

This page is a map, not a manual.  
Each line is a breadcrumb and a reminder of what I’ve touched, and what I still want to explore.  
As I build out deep dives, I’ll link them here to show how far each branch has grown.
