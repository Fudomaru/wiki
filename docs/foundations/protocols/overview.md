# Protocols

Every system speaks.  
Protocols are the grammar that shape how data moves, 
how trust is built, and how services connect.  
This section is where I learn that language.

## How this section works

I organize protocols by the **OSI model**, 
from physical transmission to application logic.  
Each protocol gets its own page, 
linked below, with explanations and notes.  
Some entries will be deep dives. 
Others will be quick references.  
The goal is clarity: Enough to understand how the protocol works, 
how it’s used, and how it can be abused or defended.

## OSI Layer Map

### Layer 1 - Physical
- Ethernet (as framing standard)

### Layer 2 - Data Link
- [ARP](/foundations/protocols/arp.md) - Address Resolution Protocol

### Layer 3 - Network
- [IP](/foundations/protocols/ip.md) - Internet Protocol
- [ICMP](/foundations/protocols/icmp.md) - Internet Control Message Protocol

### Layer 4 - Transport
- [TCP](/foundations/protocols/tcp.md) - Transmission Control Protocol
- [UDP](/foundations/protocols/udp.md) - User Datagram Protocol

### Layer 5 - Session
- [NetBIOS](/foundations/protocols/netbios.md)

### Layer 6 - Presentation
- [TLS](/foundations/protocols/tls.md) - Transport Layer Security

### Layer 7 - Application
- [HTTP](/foundations/protocols/http.md)
- [DNS](/foundations/protocols/dns.md)
- [SMTP](/foundations/protocols/smtp.md)
- [SNMP](/foundations/protocols/snmp.md)
- [FTP](/foundations/protocols/ftp.md)
- [SSH](/foundations/protocols/ssh.md)
- [SMB](/foundations/protocols/smb.md)
- [DHCP](/foundations/protocols/dhcp.md)

## Why protocols matter to me

Protocols are the **terrain** of every network.  
If I want to understand how systems communicate, how attackers pivot, or how defenders intercept — I need to understand the protocols.

This section is my map.  
Not just of what each protocol does, but how it fits into the bigger picture.
