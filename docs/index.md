# 🧠 Digital Dojo

!!! info ""

    “The faintest ink is better than the best memory.”

Welcome to my **Digital Dojo** — a living system where I train, test, and document everything I learn.  
It’s not a blog. It’s not a portfolio. It’s my external brain, structured for growth and reuse.  

## What this is

- [**Foundations**](/foundations/overview/) → Core knowledge in Linux, networking, and system internals.  
- [**Security**](/security/overview/) → Playbooks, toolbelt, and fundamentals of my cybersecurity practice.  
- [**Homelab**](/homelab/overview/) → Designs, services, and experiments running in my own network hive.  
- [**Challenges**](/challenges/overview/) → Notes and walkthroughs from CTFs and wargames (HTB, THM, OTW).  
- **Projects** → Active builds like Void Linux configs, EchoSnare hardware, and this dojo itself.  
- [**Notes**](/notes/overview/) → References, cert prep, media, and my personal warboard.  

## How to use this space

Some notes are polished guides. Others are rough sketches. That mix is intentional:  
this Dojo reflects the grind of learning — theory, practice, and failure included.  

If you’re new here:  
- Start at **Foundations** to see how I structure my base knowledge.  
- Jump to **Security** or **Challenges** if you want action.  
- Explore **Projects** for ongoing builds.  

!!! tip ""
    Don’t just read. Fork ideas. Steal commands. Break things. That’s the spirit of the Dojo.
