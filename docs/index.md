# 🧠 Digital Dojo

    “The faintest ink is better than the best memory.”


Welcome to my **Digital Dojo**, part lab notebook, part black book, part brain dump.  
This isn’t a blog. It’s not a portfolio. It’s my system. My memory, externalized. My training ground, documented.  

What you'll find here:

- **Linux Wizardry**: Real-world tricks, CLI sorcery, and system insights
- **Cybersecurity**: Core knowledge, personal playbooks, and tools of the trade
- **CTFs & Wargames**: Walkthroughs, failures, and wins — OverTheWire, HTB, TryHackMe
- **Notes**: Certs, reading lists, tech write-ups, and more

This space evolves with me. Some notes are polished. Others are messy. That’s the point — it’s all part of the grind.

     Don’t read. Steal. Fork ideas. Twist commands. Make them yours.
