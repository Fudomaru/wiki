# Notes Overview

Not everything I touch fits cleanly into my categories.  
Some things are half-formed, others experimental, others just fragments I don’t want to lose.  
This section is where I drop them.  

I don’t filter for polish here — I filter for honesty.  
If I’m exploring, struggling, or unsure, it belongs here until I find a better place for it.  
Sometimes it will grow into a full page under Foundations, Tools, or Projects.  
Other times, it will stay here as a reminder of where I’ve been.  

## Purpose

- **Catch-all**: Anything that doesn’t fit elsewhere, or not yet.  
- **Work-in-progress**: Drafts, fragments, experiments.  
- **Honesty**: Shows what I’m learning, not just what I’ve mastered.  
- **Trace**: Keeps a record of what I touched, even if it never became a full page.  

## How I’ll use it

- Write first, sort later.  
- Keep entries short and clear, but don’t worry if they’re incomplete.  
- Revisit regularly: some notes will migrate, others will stay.  
- Accept that this section is messy by design.

## Closing thought

This section is proof that I’m human.  
It shows the edges of my learning, not just the polished center.  
By keeping it open, I leave myself no excuse to avoid writing things down.  
Every fragment here is better than silence, because silence forgets.
