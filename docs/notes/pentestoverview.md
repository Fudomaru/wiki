# Pentest Overview

The purpose of this page is to deepen my understanding of the penetration testing process.  
I want to move beyond passive reading and actively build my own structured approach. 
This is something I can internalize, apply, and refine over time.

While this is primarily for my own learning, 
feel free to read, learn, and take from it what you need.

## Learning Goals

- Convert raw information into a useful structure  
- Understand the purpose behind each phase and technique  
- Identify gaps in my knowledge and areas for further study  
- Build a repeatable, adaptable process for real-world pentesting

## What Is a Pentest (Really)?

A penetration test is a service — its goal is to make the target system more secure.  
That mindset should guide every action: you're not just attacking, you're helping.  
Whether you're probing a web app or scanning a network, the end goal is always defense through understanding.

### Types of Pentests

Pentests come in many forms, depending on the target and the level of access provided.  
Each type plays a role in building a complete security posture.

#### Black, White, and Grey Box Testing

- **Black Box**: No prior access. You simulate an external attacker with zero knowledge.  
- **White Box**: Full access to source code, credentials, and architecture. Simulates an insider or developer perspective.  
- **Grey Box**: Partial access. Often represents a disgruntled employee or someone with limited insider knowledge.

These access levels apply across all pentest categories.

### Pentest Domains

#### Network Infrastructure

Testing routers, switches, firewalls, and other connected devices.  
Focus areas include misconfigurations, weak credentials, outdated firmware, and segmentation flaws.

#### Web Applications

Websites, APIs, and services — all exposed to users and attackers alike.  
Common targets include input validation, authentication, session management, and access controls.

#### Mobile Applications

Android and iOS apps are everywhere.  
Key areas include data storage, encryption, communication protocols, and backend interactions.

#### Cloud Infrastructure

With the rise of cloud and hybrid environments, misconfigured services are a major risk.  
Targets include VMs, storage buckets, IAM policies, and containerized apps — across providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

#### Physical Security

Humans are often the weakest link.  
This domain includes social engineering, badge cloning, tailgating, and bypassing access controls.  
To be honest, this is what first drew me to cybersecurity.

#### Wireless Networks

Wi-Fi and other wireless protocols are vulnerable to rogue devices, weak encryption, and poor segmentation.  
Testing includes access point configs, signal leakage, and authentication mechanisms.

#### Software

Deep testing of applications, operating systems, and firmware.  
Focus is on code quality, architecture, and secure implementation practices.
