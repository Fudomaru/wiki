# Projects Overview

This section is for my projects — personal builds, experiments, and long-term work.  
They’re rarely finished, and they don’t have to be.  
What matters is that I’ve started, shaped something, and left a trace I can return to.  

Projects evolve over time. Sometimes I revisit them after months, sometimes years.  
This section helps me pick up where I left off, without having to rediscover everything.  
It’s not only about documenting progress, but also about remembering the *why* behind each project.  

## Purpose

- **Record**: Keep track of what I’ve built and where I paused.  
- **Context**: Capture the purpose and motivation, not just the technical details.  
- **Evolution**: Show how projects change, stall, or grow over time.  
- **Revisiting**: Make it easier to restart or improve without losing momentum.  

## How I’ll use it

- Write down projects as I work on them, no matter how small or unfinished.  
- Focus on clarity: what I did, why I did it, and where I left off.  
- Return to pages when I continue a project, updating them instead of starting fresh.  
- Treat this as a log of my creative and technical journey — not just successes, but also dead ends.

## Closing thought

Every project here is a story in progress.  
Some will grow into polished systems, others will remain half-built.  
But all of them matter, because they show the trail of what I’ve explored, created, and learned.  
This section is my workshop archive: a place where nothing is wasted, because even unfinished work becomes part of the journey.
