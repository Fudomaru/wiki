# Playbooks

This is where I document the flows — not just the tools, but the thinking behind them.  
Each playbook is a repeatable method I’ve tested, broken, and rebuilt.  
They’re not static recipes. They’re living tactics.

## What belongs here

- [Recon](/security/playbooks/recon/)  
  How I scan, fingerprint, and map a target — quietly or loudly.

- Enumeration  
  Digging deeper: services, users, directories, and misconfigurations.

- Exploitation  
  Turning a weakness into access — with or without a known CVE.

- Post-Exploitation  
  What I do once inside: persistence, pivoting, data extraction.

- Obstacle Handling  
  What shuts me down — and how I adapt when it does.

## Why this matters

Tools change. Targets change.  
But the flow — the way I approach a problem — is what I train.

Each playbook is a snapshot of how I think through a challenge.  
It’s where I sharpen my instincts and document the paths I’ve walked.

## How I’ll use this space

Some playbooks will be polished — step-by-step guides with diagrams and notes.  
Others will be raw — half-finished ideas, failed attempts, and lessons learned.

That mix is intentional.  
This isn’t a trophy case. It’s a training ground.
