# Pentest Overview

The purpose of this page is to deepen my understanding of the penetration testing process.  
I want to move beyond passive reading and actively build my own structured approach. 
This is something I can internalize, apply, and refine over time.

While this is primarily for my own learning, 
feel free to read, learn, and take from it what you need.

## Learning Goals

- Convert raw information into a useful structure  
- Understand the purpose behind each phase and technique  
- Identify gaps in my knowledge and areas for further study  
- Build a repeatable, adaptable process for real-world pentesting

## What Is a Pentest (Really)?

A penetration test is a service — its goal is to make the target system more secure.  
That mindset should guide every action: you're not just attacking, you're helping.  
Whether you're probing a web app or scanning a network, the end goal is always defense through understanding.

### Types of Pentests

Pentests come in many forms, depending on the target and the level of access provided.  
Each type plays a role in building a complete security posture.

#### Black, White, and Grey Box Testing

- **Black Box**: No prior access. You simulate an external attacker with zero knowledge.  
- **White Box**: Full access to source code, credentials, and architecture. Simulates an insider or developer perspective.  
- **Grey Box**: Partial access. Often represents a disgruntled employee or someone with limited insider knowledge.

These access levels apply across all pentest categories.

### Pentest Domains

#### Network Infrastructure

Testing routers, switches, firewalls, and other connected devices.  
Focus areas include misconfigurations, weak credentials, outdated firmware, and segmentation flaws.

#### Web Applications

Websites, APIs, and services — all exposed to users and attackers alike.  
Common targets include input validation, authentication, session management, and access controls.

#### Mobile Applications

Android and iOS apps are everywhere.  
Key areas include data storage, encryption, communication protocols, and backend interactions.

#### Cloud Infrastructure

With the rise of cloud and hybrid environments, misconfigured services are a major risk.  
Targets include VMs, storage buckets, IAM policies, and containerized apps — across providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

#### Physical Security

Humans are often the weakest link.  
This domain includes social engineering, badge cloning, tailgating, and bypassing access controls.  
To be honest, this is what first drew me to cybersecurity.

#### Wireless Networks

Wi-Fi and other wireless protocols are vulnerable to rogue devices, weak encryption, and poor segmentation.  
Testing includes access point configs, signal leakage, and authentication mechanisms.

#### Software

Deep testing of applications, operating systems, and firmware.  
Focus is on code quality, architecture, and secure implementation practices.

## Structure of a Pentest

Understanding the structure of a penetration test helps build a repeatable, professional process.  
Each phase has its own purpose, tools, and mindset — and together they form a complete engagement.

---

### Pre-Engagement Phase

This phase lays the foundation for a successful pentest.  
You define the scope, objectives, and expectations with the client.

Key deliverables include:

- **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**: Scope, testing boundaries, contact points, and emergency procedures  
- **Legal Agreements**: Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), contracts, and liability clauses  
- **Communication Plan**: Who to contact, when, and how — especially in case of critical findings  

Documentation is critical here. It protects both the tester and the client.

---

### Information Gathering Phase

Also known as reconnaissance, this phase is all about collecting data on the target.  
It’s divided into:

- **Passive Recon**: Gathering publicly available information without touching the target (e.g., WHOIS, OSINT, DNS records)  
- **Active Recon**: Interacting with the target through scanning, service enumeration, and banner grabbing  

This is the first intrusive step — every action must be documented carefully.

---

### Vulnerability Assessment Phase

Here, you analyze the data from recon to identify potential weaknesses.  
You look for:

- Outdated software or services  
- Misconfigurations  
- Known vulnerabilities  
- Weak authentication mechanisms  

This phase is creative. You’re not just checking for exploits — you’re thinking about how small flaws can be chained together to create serious impact.  
This mindset also helps justify remediation later: even “minor” issues can be dangerous in combination.

---

### Exploitation Phase

Now you attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities you’ve identified.  
The goal is to demonstrate real-world impact — not just theoretical risk.

Every step must be documented:

- What was exploited  
- How it was exploited  
- What access was gained  
- Evidence that the RoE was respected  

This phase proves that the vulnerabilities are real and actionable.

---

### Post-Exploitation Phase

Once initial access is gained, you explore what an attacker could do next.  
This includes:

- Privilege escalation  
- Data access and exfiltration testing  
- Persistence mechanisms  
- Network mapping and trust discovery  

The goal is to understand the full scope of compromise — not just the entry point.

---

### Lateral Movement Phase

This phase focuses on expanding access across the network.  
You identify trust relationships and use techniques like:

- Credential harvesting  
- Pass-the-hash attacks  
- Exploiting network protocols  

Lateral movement shows how an attacker could pivot and reach sensitive systems beyond the initial breach.

---

### Proof of Concept

Here, you build reproducible examples of your findings.  
This includes:

- Scripts or tools used  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Conditions required for exploitation  

The goal is to help the client’s technical team understand and verify the issue — and test their fixes.

---

### Post-Engagement Phase

This is where you translate technical findings into actionable insights.  
Your report should include:

- Executive summary for leadership  
- Technical details for IT/security teams  
- Screenshots, logs, and evidence  
- Risk ratings and remediation recommendations  

A good report is clear, honest, and tailored to the audience.

---

### Remediation Support & Retesting

After the report is delivered, you may support the client during remediation.  
This includes:

- Answering questions  
- Clarifying findings  
- Offering guidance on fixes  

Once fixes are applied, a **retest** verifies that vulnerabilities are resolved and no new issues were introduced.  
This final step ensures the engagement leads to real security improvements.
