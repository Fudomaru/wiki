# Pentest Fundamentals

This page is my compact note on what a penetration test really is, 
why people hire them, and what I should be trying to achieve when I run one.  
This is written for me. 
Short, practical, and honest.

## What a Pentest Is

A penetration test is an engagement 
where I simulate an attacker to discover and demonstrate weaknesses in a target system. 
It is a service to improve security, not a certificate of mastery or a stunt. 
The test can be focused on a single web app, an entire network, 
a cloud environment, a mobile app, or even a physical site. 
The form changes, the purpose does not.

Key points
- It is authorized. I have permission and boundaries. No guessing.  
- It is evidence driven. Findings need reproducible proof.  
- It is goal oriented. I test to answer questions about risk, not to collect trophies.

## Why Do Pentests

People pay for pentests because they need reliable, human-driven answers 
that automated scans cannot fully provide. There are a few common drivers:

- Risk discovery and reduction. Show what an attacker can actually do and how bad that would be.  
- Validation of controls. Verify that hardening, patching, and mitigations work in practice.  
- Compliance and audit. Provide artefacts required by regulations or standards when needed.  
- Business assurance. Give leadership a clear view of exposure and prioritized fixes.  
- Learning and improvement. Teach teams where their blind spots are and how to fix them.

A pentest is value when it bridges technical evidence and business impact. 
If it does not do that, it is just noise.

## What the Goal of a Pentest Is

There are a few concrete things I want to achieve every time I test something.

Primary goals
- Find meaningful vulnerabilities. Not every low-severity finding matters, focus on actionable issues.  
- Prove impact. Move from theory to reproducible proof of compromise or business impact. Screenshots, logs, shell access, extracted files.  
- Map attack paths. Show how small weaknesses chain together to reach sensitive assets.  
- Prioritize remediation. Help the ops team know what to fix first and why.  
- Do no harm. Keep tests within the Rules of Engagement and avoid unnecessary disruption.

Secondary goals
- Verify detection. Where possible, check whether defenders notice the activity.  
- Improve playbooks. Feed findings back so the team can change configs, monitoring, or processes.  
- Create repeatable artefacts. PoCs and step-by-step reproduction for retesting.

## How This Changes My Work

If I keep these goals in mind, my approach shifts:
- I hunt for end-to-end impact, not isolated CVE checklisting.  
- I document so someone else can reproduce the same chain of events.  
- I treat safety and authorization as constraints that define my creativity, not inhibit it.  
- I frame results in business terms where it matters and technical terms where it helps.

---

## Minimum Deliverables I Expect to Produce

When I finish an engagement I want at least
- A short executive summary describing impact in plain language.  
- Technical appendices with step-by-step reproduction, commands and artifacts.  
- A clear remediation list with priorities.  
- Notes about scope, RoE, and any unexpected events during testing.

---

## Small, Practical Rules for Myself

- Before I touch anything confirm scope and contact points. Write it down.  
- Prefer reproducible, low-noise proofs of concept. Show real risk without breaking things.  
- Capture logs/screenshots at each significant step. If I can, automate evidence collection.  
- Ask: who will fix this, how long will it take, and what is the real business impact?

## Where This Page Fits

This is a fundamentals page about pentesting itself. 
The technical foundations live elsewhere under Fundamentals (networking, OS internals, protocols). 
The methodologies, tools, and playbooks belong in the Pentesting section linked from here.
