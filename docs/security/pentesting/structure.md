# Penetration Test Fundamentals

Understanding the structure of a penetration test helps build a repeatable, professional process.  
Each phase has its own purpose, tools, and mindset, and together they form a complete engagement.

---

## Pre-Engagement Phase

This phase lays the foundation for a successful pentest.  
Scope, objectives, and expectations are defined with the client.

Key deliverables include:

- **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**: Scope, testing boundaries, contact points, and emergency procedures  
- **Legal Agreements**: NDAs, contracts, and liability clauses  
- **Communication Plan**: Who to contact, when, and how (especially in case of critical findings)  

Documentation is critical here. It protects both the tester and the client.

---

## Information Gathering Phase

Also called reconnaissance. The goal is to collect data on the target.

- **Passive Recon**: Publicly available information without touching the target (WHOIS, OSINT, DNS records)  
- **Active Recon**: Direct interaction with the target through scanning, service enumeration, and banner grabbing  

This is the first intrusive step — every action must be documented carefully.

---

## Vulnerability Assessment Phase

Analyzing recon data to identify potential weaknesses, such as:

- Outdated software or services  
- Misconfigurations  
- Known vulnerabilities  
- Weak authentication mechanisms  

This phase is creative. Small flaws can often be chained together into high-impact exploits.  
Thinking this way helps justify remediation later — even “minor” issues can combine into something dangerous.

---

## Exploitation Phase

Attempting to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  
The goal is to show real-world impact, not just theoretical risk.

Every step must be documented:

- What was exploited  
- How it was exploited  
- What access was gained  
- Evidence that the RoE was respected  

This phase proves the vulnerabilities are real and actionable.

---

## Post-Exploitation Phase

Once initial access is gained, explore what an attacker could do next:

- Privilege escalation  
- Data access and exfiltration testing  
- Persistence mechanisms  
- Network mapping and trust discovery  

The goal is to understand the full scope of compromise, not just the entry point.

---

## Lateral Movement Phase

Expanding access across the network by exploiting trust relationships.  
Techniques include:

- Credential harvesting  
- Pass-the-hash  
- Exploiting network protocols  

Lateral movement shows how an attacker could pivot to sensitive systems beyond the initial breach.

---

## Proof of Concept

Building reproducible examples of findings, including:

- Scripts or tools used  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Conditions required for exploitation  

The goal is to help the client’s technical team understand, verify, and test fixes.

---

## Post-Engagement Phase

Translating technical findings into actionable insights.  
The report should include:

- Executive summary for leadership  
- Technical details for IT/security teams  
- Screenshots, logs, and evidence  
- Risk ratings and remediation recommendations  

A good report is clear, honest, and tailored to the audience.

---

## Remediation Support & Retesting

After the report is delivered, support may continue during remediation:

- Answering questions  
- Clarifying findings  
- Offering guidance on fixes  

Once fixes are applied, a **retest** verifies vulnerabilities are resolved and no new issues were introduced.  
This final step ensures the engagement leads to real security improvements.
