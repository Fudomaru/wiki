# Security

---

To defend, you have to think like an attacker.  
To attack, you have to understand what’s worth defending.  

This section is where I train that perspective. 
No “tips and tricks”, but the mindset and methods 
that reveal how systems break and how they hold.

## What belongs here

- [**Fundamentals**](/security/fundamentals/) → core security principles, models, and mental frameworks.  
- [**Toolbelt**](/security/toolbelt/overview/) → the utilities I train with: scanners, proxies, sniffers, exploit frameworks.  
- [**Playbooks**](/security/playbooks/overview/) → practical flows: recon, enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, and the obstacles that shut each down.  

The focus is **offensive security** — but never in isolation.  
Every exploit I study comes with a shadow: the defense that makes it harder, slower, or impossible.

## Why security matters to me

Security isn’t just about keeping bad actors out. It’s about knowing the terrain:  

- What do I have that’s valuable?  
- What path would someone take to get it?  
- What would make their life hell along the way?  

The old saying holds: *know your friends, but know your enemies better.*  

For me, that means documenting every angle — from the attacker’s first probe to the defender’s last line of resistance.

## How I’ll use this space

This isn’t a news feed of CVEs or copy-paste exploits.  
It’s my personal playbook: evolving, imperfect, and sharpened by practice.  

Some notes will be polished — structured guides, recon flows, tool deep-dives.  
Others will be messy — ideas mid-grind, tactics that worked once and failed twice.  

That mix is intentional. Real security work isn’t static. Neither is this dojo.
