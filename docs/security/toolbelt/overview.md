# Toolbelt

This is my kit — the tools I reach for when I need to see, break, or understand something.  
Each one earns its place here through use, not hype.

## What belongs here

- Scanners  
  [Nmap](/security/toolbelt/nmap/), RustScan, and others — how I map the terrain.

- Proxies  
  Burp Suite, ZAP — intercepting and modifying traffic.

- Sniffers  
  Wireshark, tcpdump — watching the wire.

- Exploit Frameworks  
  Metasploit, custom scripts — launching and testing payloads.

- Recon Tools  
  Sublist3r, Amass, ffuf — finding what’s exposed.

- Utility Scripts  
  One-liners, helpers, and repeatable snippets I’ve built or borrowed.

## Why this matters

Tools are only useful if I know how to wield them.  
This section isn’t a list — it’s a record of practice.

Each entry shows how I use the tool, what it taught me, and where it fits in my workflow.

## How I’ll use this space

Some tools will get full deep-dives — usage, flags, edge cases.  
Others will be quick notes — just enough to remind me how they work.

This is my reference, my kit, and my reminder that mastery comes from repetition.
