# About

---

I’m **Fudomaru** — system administrator, cybersecurity apprentice, and relentless learner.  
This dojo is the trail I leave behind: not polished for show, but raw, evolving, and real.  

---

## Why I built this

- To externalize my memory — ink over neurons.  
- To document everything I touch until I *own* it.  
- To practice mastery by stripping away fluff and getting to first principles.  

This is not just a wiki. It’s my forge.  

---

## What drives me

- The elegance of a lean, suckless system — nothing wasted.  
- The thrill of tearing into a CTF or a vulnerable box.  
- The belief that you don’t *know* something until you can rebuild it from scratch.  

Clarity is power. Every page here is me sharpening mine.

## The endgame

I’m not chasing titles.  
I’m building mastery.  
Offensive security, bug bounty, red/blue team craft — I want it all under my skin.  

I know where I stand now, and I know how far there is to climb.  
That gap doesn’t discourage me. It fuels me.

!!! tip ""
    If you’re here, steal what you find. Twist it. Break it. Make it yours.  
    That’s the only way to master anything.
