# About

---

Hi, I’m Fudomaru, system administrator, cybersecurity apprentice, and relentless learner.

---

I built this wiki to:

- Think in public (even if the public is just future-me)
- Document every lesson worth remembering
- Build a habit of writing as I learn

---

What drives me?

- The elegance of a perfectly tuned Linux system
- The thrill of cracking open a CTF box
- The idea that clarity is power, and this wiki is how I forge it

---

My endgame? Offensive security. Bug bounty. Mastery.

Right now, I’m leveling up my fundamentals and leaving a paper trail as I go.
